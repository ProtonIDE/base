### Getting themes
- You can get themes from the Website
- To use them go into the settings and press the select theme button, an input will pop up asking you to insert **Theme name or Theme URL**, The theme url should be something like: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProtonIDE/base/main/themes/standardDark.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProtonIDE/base/main/themes/standardDark.json) but if you don't want a theme from an external source you could always use the themes in the `themes/` folder, these are made by you people. If you are not sure what themes exist you can press the **see all installed themes** and you should see a list of theme names and under the name should be a URL. 

### Broken themes
- If you don't see any themes in the **all installed themes** list then your IDE might be broken, we recommend reinstalling the program, This should reload everything.
- Some themes might be broken, if you see a broken theme you can report it to us on our [Website](https://example.com) and we will either remove the theme or just flag it as **Might not work**
